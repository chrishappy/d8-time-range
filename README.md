Time Range
==========
Provides the form widget to fill in time range.  
This is just a change to the display form, so that the user doesn't need to 
enter too much content.  
This module not stored time data. The storage of time is provided by the core.  

## Installation

Install the module as every other module.

## Usage

1. Enable the **Time Range** module.
2. Create a **Date Range** field, select **Day and time** as field type.
3. To select **Time range**, go to your content type's **Form Display Settings** 
and select **Time Range**.

Because it doesn't require you to fill out the date, the default record is the 
date of the day. 
If you don't want to see the date on content's display, go to your content 
type's display settings and change the 
Date/Time format in your style.

This module is compatible with Drupal core 8.x .
